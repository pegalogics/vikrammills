                            <h2>How to send the returns?</h2>

                            <p>You must send an email to <a
                                    href="mailto:enquiry@vikrammills.com"><b>enquiry@vikrammills.com</b></a> with
                                details of products to be replaced.</p>

                            <p>If you have any questions or queries you can contact our customer support at 844 844
                                8436, we shall assist you on how to have the product sent back to us.</p>

                            <p>The replacement can take place anytime within 10 days from the date of receiving the
                                shipment.</p>

                            <p>When you return items back, please send a copy of the invoice with goods, so we can
                                process the returns/replacement easily. Failure to enclose the invoice with the returned
                                goods will result in us being unable to establish
                                from whom the items are being returned from, meaning we will be unable to process the
                                refund/replacement.</p>

                            <p>Once the goods reach our facility physical verification takes place to check for any
                                defects and to check the tags and labels.</p>

                            <p>On the completion of physical verification of goods, the refund/replacement is initiated.
                            </p>

                            <p>We will not refund the customs duties, taxes, if applicable, or paid by you at the time
                                of receiving the goods.</p>

                            <h2>Damaged Items:</h2>

                            <p>We check each item before it is sent to you for any damage in the products. However, if
                                you receive an item that you deem faulty, please email us at <a

                            <p>Please note that items that are damaged as a result of wear and tear are not considered
                                to be faulty. A majority of our items are hand embroidered and handcrafted and therefore
                                are fragile items.Over time embroidery may get
                                displaced and this is not regarded as a fault as this is due to the nature of the work.
                            </p>

                            <p>For any more questions you have regarding returns and refunds, please email us at <a
